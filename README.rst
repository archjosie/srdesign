# Centroid Shifts of Reflected Light with Angular Momentum

This code calculates the intensity centroid shifts of Laguerre-Gaussian beams
with angular momentum. The *background* folder holds relevent theory for the
underlying calculations and explores the relationships between different froms
of angular momentum.
